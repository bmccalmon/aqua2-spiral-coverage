# Documentation

This is the culmination of my work for the summer of '23 at Texas A&M. I worked closely with Prof. O'Kane and we came up with some foundational research for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that surveys coral reefs. This repo contains some code that implements our spiral coverage algorithm that can be tested in a simulator. Below is my best effort to compile everything I learned over the summer so that whoever takes over this project won't have to take too much time catching up. I apologize if some things aren't clear or if I entirely missed something. Although I did my best to write readable and modular code, it in no way is complete. The purpose of my code was to test algorithms and methods that we came up with, not to sell it as a software package (what I'm trying to say is: do not expect it to work!).

If you have any dire questions or if you think I left something out of this documentation, feel free to email me at bbmcca26@g.holycross.edu. I'll try to get back to you.

Thanks for reading and good luck!
